/**
 * A view is constructed by the {@link ViewFactory} from a Provider defined in
 * the sitemap building process. When the view is selected for use, calls are
 * made against {@link KrailViewChangeListener}s added to {@link Navigator}, and
 * {@link NavigationAwareView} inteface, in the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * {@link KrailViewChangeListener#beforeViewChange(CancellableKrailViewChangeEvent)}</li>
 * <li>{@link NavigationAwareView#onOutboundNavigation(CancellableKrailViewChangeEvent)} (on current
 * view)</li>
 * <li>{@link NavigationAwareView#beforeInboundNavigation(CancellableKrailViewChangeEvent)} (on target
 * view)</li>
 * <li>{@link NavigationAwareView#afterInboundNavigation(KrailViewChangeEvent)} (on target view)</li>
 * <li>{@link KrailViewChangeListener#afterViewChange(KrailViewChangeEvent)}</li>
 * </ol>
 * Each method, is passed a {@link KrailViewChangeEvent}, which contains the
 * current {@link NavigationState} so that, for example, parameter information
 * can be used to determine how the View is to be built or respond in some other
 * way to URL parameters. Up to {@link #beforeInboundNavigation} is passed a
 * {@link CancellableKrailViewChangeEvent} that could be used to cancel the
 * navigation using {@link CancellableKrailViewChangeEvent#cancel()}
